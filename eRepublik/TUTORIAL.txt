Hey, for you to better understand the program I figured that I should simulate a session with the iTrader.

Just open it up. If it is the first time, ignore the "Could not load data" and type your nick.

now off to the interactive session. First, I advise you to read the README.txt that comes with the package.

Now for the commands:
(Lines starting with $ are things you should type. EVERYTHING except for the $)

Start of by asking the program what my ID must be... Use the find command for this!

$find Rojer97

and it prints the top results. you can find my ID there!
register me in your database

$register 6328829 Rojer97 -n Rojer97 -i good guy, created this program

That stored my ID in the database, along with my IRC nick (-n flag) and some chaty chat with the -i flag.

now if you type

$check 6328829

The program will tell you that the given ID is registered

Now you are going to buy 340 weapons Q7 from me, at 9.7 a piece...
But how much is that??

$calc 340*9.7

And the program prints 3298. Sometimes, the program could say something like 3297.9999999999995
That is because computers have always had problems with decimals... In a future update I'll fix
 the print to prevent this.

So, if the cost for 340 is 3298, and you were to buy me that, you could register the trade:

$trade buy 6328829 wq7 340 3298

and you would get some nice information printed.
after this, your log file is not empty anymore, so you can use the <log> command to check your trades!
You only have one, but lets check "all of them"

$log all

Now, if you type

$print

you current stock is printed and your profit too. Well, it is a negative one, so let's sell something!
You found this guy willing to pay 3400 for your 340 weapons! Sweet! Let's pretend his ID is 9999999

$trade sell 9999999 wq7 340 3400

Now the program tells you you have 102cc profit and you are out of stock! But let's save that profit!
(Now you can either actually buy the gold or not, but to remove the profit from the counter, you use this next command:)
At a rate of +/- 200cc/g, we could say you can get 0.5 gold for 100 CC.

$convert 0.5 100

Well, with so many commands you already forgot what you typed about me! Easy! Know my name?
 It was Rojer something, right?

$search Rojer

And the program tells you about every entry that has "Rojer" somewhere in its data.
 You get my id and type:

$print 6328829

And it tells you about me!
Now if you would like to update my information, do:

$register -u 6328829 Rojer97 -n Rojer97 -i I like this guy!

Try to issue that command without the (-u) part. It will yell at you because I already exist!
Also try this:

$register -u 6328829 Rojer
$print 6328829

Notice that altough you only changed my nick, since all the other things were missing,
 they were updated to be nothing!

Now why don't you use <find> to search for some of your most usual costumers
and use the register command to register them!
after that, try this command:

$list

Now you can also do another thing! You can use the search command to sort the results alphabetically or numerically.

$search (something to search for) -a

That sorts alphabetically.

$search (...) -n

Numerically.
Trying

$search (...) -n -a OR $search (...) -na
 
will just make the program yell at you :D

Type help to find all the commands there are:

$help

If you forget the syntax of a command, type the command and a <-h> like this:

$trade -h

That way you can see the position of each argument!

Now that you are done with all the commands, use the last one! The exit one!

$exit

Now I advise you to erase the files itrade.data, itrade_traders.data
 and itrade_trades.log, and to run the program again just to set your name!
